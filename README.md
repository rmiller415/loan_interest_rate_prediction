# Loan Interest Rate Prediction  
## Overview:  
This is a project I created using the [Kaggle Credit Risk Default Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset) as a companion to my [Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/rmiller415/credit_default_risk) project. The Credit Risk Dataset has several missing values for the loan interest rate feature. I attempted to predict the loan interest rates here. However, I was ultimately unsuccessful at reliably predicting interest rates. I have abandoned this project, but I may return to it later if I find the time. My goal was to predict interest rates and use those predictions in the credit risk notebook.  
**Context:** In many business settings, datasets are incomplete and need to be found via imputation, collection of additional information, or other means. In some cases, imputation can cause issues with the algorithms or can lead to overfitting. I could not request the missing values because the dataset is synthetic and hosted on Kaggle. So I attempted to find the data on my own using patterns. I did this primarily to challenge myself and to show my familiarity with regressors and gradient descent.  

## Tools Used:  
### Python was used as the primary coding language.  
**Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn  
**Data Storage/Structures:** Pandas and NumPy  
**Data Transformation and Feature Selection:** sklearn, scipy  
**Models:** sklearn (LinearSVR, RandomForestRegressor, GridSearch)
